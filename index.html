          Welcome all to my landing page! My name is Josh Eshleman. I am a 28 year old aspiring developer.
          I spent years 19-28 of my life working in Distribution and Logistics for Ollie's Bargain Outlet Inc. I started
          with
          Ollie's in my home town of Harrisburg, PA a year after graduating high school. I continued to further my
          career
          within the company, until an opportunity to move and become one of five people selected to start up the
          company's
          second Distribution Center presented itself. Opening in Commerce, GA in 2014, this 1 million square foot
          Distribution Center
          rapidly grew from 5-300 employees.
           I was the Supervisor of my own department, as well as 30+ associates, from
          March, 2014 - January, 2019, and gained an expert array of skills in regards to people management.

          I was a very successful supervisor and was offered promotional opportunities on multiple occasions however, I
          respectfully declined
          these positions, as I was considering a change in career paths. This change was made possible when my wife
          graduated
          from Mercer University College of Pharmacy and began a career of her own. I began seeking other lifelong
          interests
          and taught myself some basic coding skills. Realizing a more professional learning environment and
          certification
          would likeley be required to turn coding into a profession, I sought out and found Georiga Tech's Coding
          Bootcamp program, immediately enrolled,
          and am currently a student of.
