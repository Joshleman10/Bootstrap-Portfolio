              Welcome all to my landing page!  My name is Josh Eshleman.  I am a 28 year old aspiring developer.
              I spent years 19-28 of my life working in Distribution and Logistics for Ollie's Bargain Outlet Inc.  I started with
              Ollie's in my home town of Harrisburg, PA a year after graduating high school.  I continued to further my career 
              within the company, until an oppourtunity to move and become one of five people selected to start up the company's
              second Distribution Center presented itself.  Opening in Commerce, GA in 2014, this 1 million square foot Distribution Center
              rapidly grew from 5-300 employees.

            <p>
            I was the Supervisor of my own department, as well as 30+ associates, from 
            March, 2014 - July, 2018 and gained an expert array of skills in regards to people management.
            I was a very succesful supervisor and was offered promotional oppourtunities on multiple occasions however, I respectfully declined 
            these positions, as I was considering a change in career paths.  This change was made possible when my wife graduated 
            from Mercer University College of Pharmacy and began a career of her own.  I began seeking other lifelong interests 
            and taught myself some basic coding skills.  Realizing a more professional learning environment and certification 
            would likeley be required to turn coding into a profession, I sought out and found Georiga Tech's Coding Bootcamp program, immediately enrolled, 
            and am currently a student of.
